Using API from crudcrud.com, if the API response used requests already 100, go to the website and make a new endpoint, don't forget to edit the API endpoint in .env file. For the mock data uncomment the mockdata function inside the iconbutton in AppBar in ListProductPage (listproduct.dart) *it's only too add 1 mock data to prevent many requests.
